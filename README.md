So, for EE 371, we were tasked to complete a multiple barrier problem for extra credit using Python/MATLAB. Being that MATLAB
isn't a completely free program, we decided to use Python and go with it. Most of the work was done by Hunter (the other 
contributor) but I started the program. This is what problem the program was based off of.


Hope you enjoy if you use the program and star our repository if you do.

Cheers,
